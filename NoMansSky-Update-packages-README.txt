🎯 Project Goal

Build a hard‑science survival spacecraft for Orbiter 2024 with:
    Realistic environmental hazards
    Gravity‑driven structural and system failures
    Thermal, pressure, radiation, and atmospheric modeling
    Engine systems that degrade under stress
    A flight computer that can be damaged and repaired
    EVA support
    A cockpit HUD with warnings
    Fully integrated gameplay loops (survive, repair, manage resources)
